# **Kindergarten Care**

Kindergarten Care or KCare in short is an option for parents who are interested to enroll their child for a full-day care service. It is available for children being enrolled in our MK, which is before or after the MK session. KCare operates from Monday to Friday from 7.00am to 7.00pm.

The programme provides time and space for children to engage in play, exploration and discovery through a variety of specially designed modular activities (tinkering, cookery, sand and water play, dramatic play, outdoor and gardening).
