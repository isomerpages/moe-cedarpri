**MK Reads! Programme**

MK Reads! aims to promote shared reading between parents and children at home. According to findings, a better home literacy environment helps your child to acquire a strong foundation in language and literacy skills. Shared reading, i.e. reading with your child, is an important component of home literacy environments.

There are three key components of MK Reads!

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Books**&nbsp;– At the end of the week during the term, children will bring home a EL or MTL book to enjoy the book together with their parents, and return the book promptly the following Monday.

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Reading record, tips and strategies**&nbsp;– After reading the book together, parents will fill in a reading record with their child. Periodically, some tips and strategies are shared with parents to support engagement in the shared reading sessions with their child.

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Videos and infographics**&nbsp;– MOE&nbsp;also&nbsp;prepares videos and infographics with tips and strategies to support&nbsp;shared reading at home.

### Centre Based Programme
