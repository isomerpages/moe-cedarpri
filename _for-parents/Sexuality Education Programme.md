<h1><strong>Sexuality Education Programme</strong></h1>
<p><strong>MOE Sexuality Education in Schools</strong>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sexuality Education
(SEd) in schools is about enabling students to understand the physiological,
social and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy
and rewarding relationships including those with members of the opposite
sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters.
SEd is premised on the importance of the family as the basic unit of society.
This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear
family units with extended family support. The teaching and learning of
SEd is based on respect for the values and beliefs of the different ethnic
and religious communities in Singapore on sexuality issues.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The goals of Sexuality
Education are:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
help students make wise, responsible and informed decisions through the
provision of accurate, current and age-appropriate&nbsp;knowledge&nbsp;on
human sexuality and the consequences of sexual activity;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help
students know themselves and build healthy and rewarding relationships
through the acquisition of&nbsp;social and emotional skills&nbsp;of self-awareness,
management of their thoughts, feelings and behaviours, development of empathy
for others, possession of effective communication, problem-solving and
decision-making skills; and</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help students
develop a moral compass, respect for themselves and for others as sexual
beings, premised on the family as the basic unit of society, through the
inculcation of&nbsp;positive mainstream values and attitudes&nbsp;about
sexuality.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key messages of
Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love
and respect yourself as you love and respect others;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Build positive
relationships based on love and respect (which are the foundation for strong
families);</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make responsible
decisions for yourself, your family and society; and</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstinence before
marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV and unintended pregnancies.
Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved ones.</p>

<p><strong>Overview of Cedar Primary</strong>&nbsp;<strong>School’s</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Sexuality Education Programme for 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education
is delivered in a holistic manner through the school curriculum.&nbsp;The
content for Sexuality Education is grouped into five main themes: Human
Development, Interpersonal Relationships, Sexual Health, Sexual Behaviour,
and, Culture, Society and Law. You may click&nbsp;<a href="https://go.gov.sg/moe-sexuality-education-scope" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;for
more information on the scope of Sexuality Education in the school curriculum.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The subjects that incorporate topics on sexuality
include:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Science
<br>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Character and Citizenship
Education (CCE)</p>
<p><strong>Sexuality Education Lessons</strong>
</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The upper primary years
mark the onset of puberty. With better nutrition and improved health care,
children are reaching puberty at a younger age and have to grapple with
physical, emotional and psychological changes in themselves. The implication
is that our children are becoming biologically ready for sexual activity
sooner without necessarily having the corresponding cognitive or emotional
maturity to modulate their behaviours. Furthermore, our young are also
exposed to a wide range of influences that could endanger health and undermine
the integrity of the family. Our students require guidance so that they
can respond with discernment to the sexual messages in the media and other
sources.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education
(SEd) lessons are taught as part of CCE (FTGP) at Primary 5 and 6. In SEd,
students learn to understand the physiological, social and emotional changes
they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships
including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed
and responsible decisions on sexuality matters.</p>
