# **KidsZone@Cedar**

The school has partnered with Bartley Care Community Services (BCCS) in setting up KidsZone@Cedar. KidsZone@Cedar is established in 2019 and the aim is to provide a safe and stimulating environment for students from Cedar Primary School to engage in meaningful and fun activities after school. It emphasises character building through opportunities for learning and playing new games and sports. All students of Cedar Primary School are able to join KidsZone@Cedar. KidsZone@Cedar also provides family support services to students and their parents.

It opens daily from Monday to Friday, except during school holidays and public holidays. The operation hours are 1.45 pm–5 pm on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday; 1.15 pm–-4 pm on Wednesday and Friday.
