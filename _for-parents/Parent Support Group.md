# **Parent Support Group**

The PSG (Parent Support Group) In Cedar Primary comprises of a group of committed parents who have volunteered their time and service to partner the school in its efforts to provide a holistic education for our students. The members have been actively supporting the teachers by carrying out recess activities during cultural and NE events as well as those promoting Cyber-wellness amongst the students. Their presence and involvement in school, allows for the establishment of a strong home school partnership. The PSG also serve as role-models of volunteerism as well as active contributors, for our students.

The PSG would like to invite more parents to join them.  Parents who are interested in joining the PSG should apply to [cedar\_ps@moe.edu.sg](mailto:cedar_ps@moe.edu.sg).
