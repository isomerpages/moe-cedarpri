# **Virtual Tour @ Cedar Primary**

Dear Parents/Guardians,

_A warm welcome to Cedar Primary School’s Virtual Tour!_

Located a stone’s throw away from the newly developed Bidadari Estate, Cedar Primary School is where we build the foundation to foster your children’s love for learning.

We believe in developing your children holistically – cognitively, physically, aesthetically, socially and, last but not least, in character and learning dispositions.

Hence, in Cedar Primary, beginning with the lower primary, opportunities are provided for the children to learn through play, to spark their curiosity, to think creatively (in line with our Applied Learning Programme – Creative and Inventive Thinking), to make friends, and to develop habits and skills to enable them to learn on their own – all these in the hope that the children will enjoy learning and look forward to coming to school each day.

We welcome you to follow our Primary 1 students as they show you what a day in Cedar Primary School looks like. Enjoy!
