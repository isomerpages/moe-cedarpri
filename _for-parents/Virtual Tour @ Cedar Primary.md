<h1><strong>Virtual Tour @ Cedar Primary</strong></h1>
<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p><em>A warm welcome to Cedar Primary School’s Virtual Tour!</em>
</p>
<p>Located a stone’s throw away from the newly developed Bidadari Estate,
Cedar Primary School is where we build the foundation to foster your children’s
love for learning.</p>
<p>We believe in developing your children holistically – cognitively, physically,
aesthetically, socially and, last but not least, in character and learning
dispositions.</p>
<p>Hence, in Cedar Primary, beginning with the lower primary, opportunities
are provided for the children to learn through play, to spark their curiosity,
to think creatively (in line with our Applied Learning Programme – Creative
and Inventive Thinking), to make friends, and to develop habits and skills
to enable them to learn on their own – all these in the hope that the children
will enjoy learning and look forward to coming to school each day.</p>
<p>We welcome you to follow our Primary 1 students as they show you what
a day in Cedar Primary School looks like. Enjoy!</p>

<p>Surrounded by lush greenery, Cedar Primary has a learning environment
conducive to nurturing and developing our students, or Cedarians as they
are affectionately known.</p>
<p>With the completion of a major upgrading project in 2019, the school is
now furnished with an Indoor Sports Hall, spacious classrooms and specially
designed rooms for teaching and learning. &nbsp;The improved facilities
allow the school to embark on programmes that are tailored to meet the
diverse needs of our students. Outdoor spaces are also filled with flora
and fauna, augmented with displays, murals, and manipulative objects for
students to participate in experiential learning and learning trails beyond
the classrooms.</p>
