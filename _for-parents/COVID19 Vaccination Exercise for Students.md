**COVID-19 Vaccination Exercise for Students in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning**

Dear Parents/Guardians,

MOE is commencing COVID-19 vaccination for students in schools and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) as part of the national vaccination exercise. Parents/guardians of all eligible students aged 12 and above as at 1 June 2021 will receive the SMS invites over the next two weeks to schedule students’ vaccination appointments. Students whose 12th birthday fall after 1 June 2021 will be invited for vaccination at a later date. Parental/guardian consent is required for students below the age of 18 when booking vaccination appointment slots via the National Appointment System. Parents/guardians of children aged 12 and children in SPED schools are required to accompany their child/ward for the vaccination.

While the COVID-19 vaccination is not mandatory, we would like to encourage all medically eligible students to be vaccinated when the vaccine is made available to them and to register for a vaccination slot early. Do consult your child’s/ward’s doctor if your child/ward has underlying medical conditions that might affect their medical eligibility. You may read the attached Parent Kit and Info Sheet or click on the link to the Press Release for more information.

MOE will be organising webinars on 1 June (5pm– 6pm) and 3 June (12pm – 1 pm) to address questions you may have regarding the vaccination exercise for students. The webinars will feature an MOH medical expert and MOE representatives. The webinar link is attached below. You may share your questions with us before the webinars via the link to the survey form. Due to the limited capacity of the webinars (3000pax), attendees will be admitted on a first-come first-served basis. Video snippets from the webinar will be uploaded online after the sessions.

Thank you.
