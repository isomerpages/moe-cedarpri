The highlight of our ML programmes is the MTL Fortnight. This programme is packed with language and cultural activities to increase students' interest in the Malay language and culture. The two-week programme provides students with the opportunity to visit some of Singaporeâ€™s iconic and historic attractions. After the learning journeys, students are involved craftwork and projects related to the Malay language and culture. They also learn some Malay cultural performing arts as part of the programme.
