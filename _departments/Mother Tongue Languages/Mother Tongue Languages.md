# **Mother Tongue Languages**

#### Vision and Mission

**Vision:**
Learners with lasting appreciation for Mother Tongue Language and Culture

**Mission:**
Teaching and Learning Mother Tongue language as a “living” language

##### Primary Goals of Mother Tongue Languages:

The Bilingual Policy has always been the cornerstone of Singapore’s education policy. The 3 primary goals of Mother Tongues Languages are:

•	Communication – proficiency and ability to communicate in MTL for the competitive edge

•	Culture – understand and develop unique identity through deeper appreciation of culture, traditions, literature and history.

•	Connection – to connect with communities across Asia and the people who speak that language and share that culture.

In Cedar Primary, we strive to create an active and interactive teaching and learning environment, so as to support and enable every student to learn MTL to as high a level as each student is able to.

##### Key Programmes:

**MTL Fortnight and P4 Cultural & Language Camp**

The primary objective of MTL Fortnight and Language Camp is to create an immersive environment for the learning of MTL by adopting a more integrated approach in incorporating enrichment programmes into our overall MTL Learning plans for students.

During the Fortnight, we provide platforms for students to actively learn MTL and the associated culture so that the students can experience MTL as “living languages”. Students learn to use MTL and appreciate culture through hands-on tasks such as drama, performances, story-telling, language game stations, competitions, talent corners, exhibitions and talks.
