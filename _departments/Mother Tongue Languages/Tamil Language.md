# **Tamil Language**

In order to render Tamil a 'living language', the Tamil Language unit instils in Tamil students a love for their mother tongue and develops their ability to use it with confidence through various enrichment programmes and activities.

TL Enrichment Programmes/Activities:

*   MTL Fortnight and P4 Cultural & Language Camp 2019 (Term 2)

It is important for Cedar Primary's Tamil Language students to attain a certain level of proficiency in the language so that they are able to express themselves competently as well as to appreciate the historical, ethnic, cultural and moral values found in Tamil literature. The values imbibed will enhance their wholesome development and nurture good citizenship. 

To attain this objective, the Tamil department creates opportunities for our students to boost their creative thinking abilities and communication skills. We also provide the means for them to understand their cultural roots through participation in a variety of cultural activities and programmes, such as the MTL Fortnight.
