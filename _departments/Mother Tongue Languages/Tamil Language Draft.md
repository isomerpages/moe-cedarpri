<h3><strong>Traditional Indian costumes</strong></h3>
<p>Draping a saree can be a fun and meaningful experience for girls, while
tying a veshti can be just as enriching for boys, especially as they discover
the cultural significance behind these traditional garments.</p>
<p>This hands-on experience for the pupils promotes teamwork, creativity
and an appreciation for cultural diversity!</p>
