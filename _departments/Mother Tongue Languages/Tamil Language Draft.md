<p>The school aims to nurture students to be active learners
<br>and proficient users of their Mother Tongue Language (MTL). As such we
are pleased to organize the <strong>Mother Tongue Language Fortnight </strong>which
is packed with fun-filled MTL learning activities, thus encouraging students
to use MTL and appreciate the heritage and culture associated with the
language.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>The Cedar MTL Fortnight was held from Monday, 25 March 2024 to Friday,
5 April 2024.</p>

<p><strong>Traditional Indian costumes</strong>
<br>Draping a saree can be a fun and meaningful experience for girls, while
tying a veshti can be just as enriching for boys, especially as they discover
the cultural significance behind these traditional garments.</p>
<p>This hands-on experience for the pupils promotes teamwork, creativity
and an appreciation for cultural diversity!</p>
