<p><strong>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; National Education &nbsp;(NE)</strong>
<br>NE provides opportunities for our students to explore and examine their
identity as Singaporeans and arrive at a common set of ideals and values.
The following table shows the key dispositions for citizenship in Singapore
which shapes the purpose and approach to NE:</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 75%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCE_3.png">
</div>
<p>In Cedar Primary, we commemorate the 4 NE Events- Total Defence Day, International
Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day. For each of these
events, we use the Head, Heart and Hands approach to create meaningful
experiences for our students. Lessons are taught explicitly in class during
the CCE (FTGP) lessons and exciting activities are organised during recess
to provide for hands-on learning opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education</strong>
<br>Sexuality Education in schools is about enabling students to understand
the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they
mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with
members of the opposite sex, and&nbsp; make wise, informed, and responsible
decisions on sexuality matters.
<br>The Sexuality Education lessons are for Primary 5 and 6 students are carried
out during CCE (FTGP) &nbsp;and more information can be found in the link

</p>
<p><strong>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mental Health</strong>
<br>Mental Health is taught explicitly&nbsp; in CCE &nbsp;Topics like:
<br>i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strengthening resilience and well-being
(e.g. having a growth mindset, positive self-talk)
<br>ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Differentiating between stress and distress(e.g.
managing stress)
<br>iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enhancing help-seeking behaviour (infused
into various lessons)
<br>iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Showing care and empathy to others (e.g.
caring for family, friends, the community)
<br>In Cedar Primary, we use a strength-based approach of ‘I Am, I Can, I
Have’ that students can refer to when they are going through challenges.</p>

<p><strong>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Education and Career Guidance (ECG)</strong>
<br>ECG enables students to develop a sense of purpose in life.&nbsp; By nurturing
self-awareness and self-directedness for lifelong learning,&nbsp; ECG helps
students to develop a growth mindset, adaptability&nbsp; and a resilient
attitude&nbsp; to embrace future opportunities and appreciate the value
of all occupations.&nbsp; The goals of ECG are captured in the picture
below.</p>

<p><strong>Social Emotional Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>In Cedar Primary School, we look into taking care of the holistic development
of our students. Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) is one of the key
strategies for holistic development as we seek to build competencies in
our students to develop them into well-rounded individuals.</p>
<p>This is carried out through specific curriculum for SEL: Form Teacher
Guidance Period (FTGP), SEL Lessons, Sexuality Education, Education &amp;
Career Guidance, and Cyber Wellness.</p>
<p><strong>a)</strong>  <strong>Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)</strong>
</p>
<p>Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) provides quality interaction time
between form teachers and students, and equip students with social and
emotional competencies.</p>
<p>The FTGP concept is illustrated as below:</p>

</div>
<p><strong>b) Education &amp; Career Guidance</strong>
</p>
<p>Education &amp; Career Guidance is a developmental process which facilitates
the acquisition of attitudes, skills and knowledge that will enable students
to better understand themselves, explore viable education and career options,
make informed decisions and develop plans to achieve their career aspirations</p>

<h4>II. CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION</h4>
<p>As we focus on building up the character of our Cedarians, we also look
at cultivating responsible citizens that will contribute back to society
and make a difference, whether they are in school or out in the community.</p>
<p>Various key programmes like CCE lessons, Values in Action (VIA), National
Education, Social Studies and Environmental Awareness have been put in
place to engage the heads, hearts and hands of the students.</p>
<p>With the NE Review 2017, National Education in Singapore is now anchored
on the following citizenship dispositions, which will enable our youth
to realise their part in the flourishing of their community and nation:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A Sense of Belonging</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Sense of Reality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Sense of Hope</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Will to Act</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>a) NE Core Events</strong>
</p>
<p>The following are the outcomes of the NE core events:</p>
<p><strong>Total Defence Day</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students know the aspects of Total Defence and how they can play a part
in each aspect. Even at their age, their participation&nbsp;in Total Defence
is important and everyone can (and should) play a part in defending the
country.</p>
<p><strong>International Friendship Day</strong>
</p>
<p>Students learn about and appreciate other cultures in cosmopolitan Singapore.&nbsp;
We nurture in our students the spirit of&nbsp;&nbsp;friendship and collaboration
among different peoples. Students are also guided on keeping an open mindset,
and expressing an&nbsp;appreciation of the contributions of foreigners
working and studying in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Racial Harmony Day</strong>
</p>
<p>Students make friends with people of other races and religions. They learn
that in Singapore, people are treated equally regardless of their race
and religion and students should appreciate the different cultures that
make up Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>National Day</strong>
</p>
<p>Students build a greater sense of historical importance. National Day
marks our separation from Malaysia, and our emergence as an independent
country in the community of nations.</p>
<p><strong>b) Values In Action</strong>
</p>
<p>Service to the school, community and nation, leadership roles and responsibilities,
CCAs and group work are important platforms that we provide for our students
so that they can live out the school values in the process of serving others
and working with one another.</p>
<p><strong>c) Learning Journeys</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the Social Studies curriculum, teachers and students go on
field-based learning journeys to extend and enrich their learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Field-based learning allows the students to contextualise their learning
experience in an authentic real- world setting, thus enabling the relational
learning of concepts and content. Students would also be able to conduct
hands-on exploration in a focused area of study, thus being engaged in
multi-sensory modes.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Singapore is Our Home</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building Confidence in our Future</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instilling Pride in Singapore's Achievements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developing An Appreciation for the Past and Present</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understanding Singapore: Its Constraints, Challenges and Opportunities</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>d) Environmental Awareness</strong>
</p>
<p>In our effort to teach the students that we all belong to a connected
community and to develop them to be responsible citizens, the school has
an environmental awareness programme where we commemorate events like Earth
Day, Earth Hour, Biodiversity Week and organise termly recycling campaigns
where students are encouraged to bring items from home for recycling. We
warmly welcome all parents and guardians to join us in this recycling initiative
and help cultivate this good habit even</p>
