<p><strong>a) National Education &nbsp;(NE)</strong>
<br>NE provides opportunities for our students to explore and examine their
identity as Singaporeans and arrive at a common set of ideals and values.
The following table shows the key dispositions for citizenship in Singapore
which shapes the purpose and approach to NE:</p>

</div>
<p>In Cedar Primary, we commemorate the 4 NE Events- Total Defence Day, International
Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day. For each of these
events, we use the Head, Heart and Hands approach to create meaningful
experiences for our students. Lessons are taught explicitly in class during
the CCE (FTGP) lessons and exciting activities are organised during recess
to provide for hands-on learning opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>b) Sexuality Education</strong>
<br>Sexuality Education in schools is about enabling students to understand
the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they
mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with
members of the opposite sex, and&nbsp; make wise, informed, and responsible
decisions on sexuality matters.
<br>The Sexuality Education lessons are for Primary 5 and 6 students are carried
out during CCE (FTGP) &nbsp;and more information can be found in the link

<p><strong>c) Mental Health</strong>
<br>Mental Health is taught explicitly&nbsp; in CCE &nbsp;Topics like:
<br>i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strengthening resilience and well-being
(e.g. having a growth mindset, positive self-talk)
<br>ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Differentiating between stress and distress(e.g.
managing stress)
<br>iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enhancing help-seeking behaviour (infused
into various lessons)
<br>iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Showing care and empathy to others (e.g.
caring for family, friends, the community)
<br>In Cedar Primary, we use a strength-based approach of ‘I Am, I Can, I
Have’ that students can refer to when they are going through challenges.</p>

<br>Cyberwellness in CCE focuses on the positive and psychological well-being
of students as they navigate the digital world. It involves an understanding
of the norms of responsible behaviour regarding technology use as well
as knowledge, skills, values and attitudes on how to protect oneself and
other users in the cyber space.

<p><strong>a) CCE Lessons</strong>
<br>Classroom lessons for CCE provide dedicated curriculum time for the explicit
teaching and learning of values and social emotional competencies, as well
as engaging and&nbsp; building&nbsp; relationships with our students. CCE
lessons in primary schools comprise of the following:</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 75%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCE_7.png">
</div>
<p>CCE (Form Teacher Guidance Period), CCE (Mother Tongue Language) and PAL(
Programme for Active Learning). These lessons have been planned and developed
in alignment with CCE Learning Outcomes with different contexts applied
in each lesson. This facilitates deeper learning and students’ application
of the knowledge and skills in various situations.
<br>The Social Studies curriculum complements the CCE curriculum in nurturing
citizenship dispositions. Through Social Studies lessons, students deepen
and broaden their understanding of what it means to be a citizen of a country
and the world by learning key concepts and skills drawn from Humanities
subjects like Geography, History and Sociology. The goals of the Social
Studies curriculum&nbsp; are shown in the picture below:</p>

<p><strong>b) Key Student Development Experiences</strong>
<br>Student development experiences are programmes and activities that contribute
towards the holistic development of our students in physical, aesthetic,
intellectual, moral and social domains.
<br>
<br><strong>Values in Action (VIA)</strong>
<br>In Cedar Primary, the objectives of our VIA&nbsp; initiatives are as follows:
<br>·&nbsp; To nurture Cedarians to be socially responsible citizens who contribute
meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of
values, knowledge and skills.
<br>·&nbsp; To engender student ownership and initiative.
<br>·&nbsp; To reflect on experience, the values Cedarians have put into practice,
and how they can continue to contribute meaningfully.

<summary>Caring and Enabling School Environment</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The quality of the learning environment shapes how students perceive and
experience CCE Lessons and Student Development Experiences. A caring and
enabling school environment for learning is one where students perceive
that both teachers and peers care about their well-being and learning,
and students show care and support to one another.
<br>A caring and enabling school environment for learning enables students
to:
<br>• develop a growth mindset and self-discipline.
<br>• learn to overcome challenges.
<br>• sense make
<br>• take ownership of their class and school community; and
<br>• be motivated and empowered to master the CCE Learning Outcomes.
<br>Teachers can provide a caring and enabling learning environment by nurturing
a sense of belonging, guiding students to appreciate diversity, empowering
them to be active learners and monitoring and supporting their well-being
proactively.</p>
