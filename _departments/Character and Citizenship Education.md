**Social Emotional Learning**

In Cedar Primary School, we look into taking care of the holistic development of our students. Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) is one of the key strategies for holistic development as we seek to build competencies in our students to develop them into well-rounded individuals.

This is carried out through specific curriculum for SEL: Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP), SEL Lessons, Sexuality Education, Education & Career Guidance, and Cyber Wellness.


**a)** **Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)**

Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) provides quality interaction time between form teachers and students, and equip students with social and emotional competencies.

The FTGP concept is illustrated as below:

**b) Education & Career Guidance**

Education & Career Guidance is a developmental process which facilitates the acquisition of attitudes, skills and knowledge that will enable students to better understand themselves, explore viable education and career options, make informed decisions and develop plans to achieve their career aspirations
