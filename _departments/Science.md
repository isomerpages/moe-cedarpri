# **Science**

### Vision and Mission

The Science department seeks to provide every Cedarian with a Science education that prepares them to be creative thinkers in a connected community. Students will:

*   Acquire scientific literacy to participate in active discussions on science-related issues, contextualise them and work on solutions;
*   Engage in scientific inquiry where opportunities are provided to initiate the inquiry, design and conduct experiments, present and analyse data, interpret results and draw conclusions; and
*   Develop problem-solving skills to devise solutions to real world issues.

### Curriculum and Programmes

**Science Framework**

The Science Curriculum Framework encapsulates the thrust of science education to prepare our students to be sufficiently adept as effective citizens, be able to function in and contribute to an increasingly technologically-driven society.
