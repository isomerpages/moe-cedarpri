### Vision and Mission

In Cedar Primary School, we aim to develop, reinforce and extend language acquisition and mastery through enjoyment of the language, promotion of extensive reading; and leveraging oracy, reading and writing skills to develop knowledge and independent use of the language.

Guided by the English Language Syllabus, we also incorporate experiential learning and _Making Thinking Visible_ routines into the curriculum through various learning activities and opportunities.
