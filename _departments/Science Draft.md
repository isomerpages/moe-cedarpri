<p>In alignment to the MOE’s Curriculum Framework and the School’s Vision,
the science teachers in Cedar use the Inquiry-Based Learning Approach to
teach Science and through the various hands-on activities, we hope that
our students are able relate the role of Science in their daily life, society
and environment.
<br>The teachers also plan Science programmes and work with key partners to
nurture the joy of learning and to promote lifelong learning.
<br>
<br>Here are the programmes that the students will experience in Cedar Primary
School:
<br>
<br><strong>Every Child a Seed programme</strong>
<br>NParks will be providing every Primary 3 student with a plant starter
kit consisting of a pot, potting mix and some seeds.
<br>Beyond learning about the science behind plant growth, students will also
learn values such as resilience, care and responsibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mushroom Growing</strong>
<br>In addition to growing their own mushrooms and learning more about mushroom
(fungi), the students will learn and understand the importance of growing
your own food and gain a greater understanding of food self-sufficiency.</p>

<p><strong>Biodiversity Week for Schools</strong>
<br>To commemorate the annual International Day for Biological Diversity,
Biodiversity Week for Schools will feature activities that celebrate Singapore’s
natural heritage and engage the students in learning about our native flora

<p><strong>&nbsp;Terrarium Building</strong>
<br>Students will take this opportunity to observe that the terrarium ecosystem
is similar to the earth’s water cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Eco-Trail</strong>
<br>At the school garden, our students get to see the content in their science
textbooks come to life when get to observe the flora and fauna in the garden&nbsp;and
solve question about them during the school-based Science learning trails.</p>

<p><strong>Science Toy Project</strong>
<br>The Science Toy Project seeks to foster inventiveness through Science,
allowing students to go beyond just knowing scientific facts and concepts
from textbooks to applying them creatively. Knowledge application will
then positively reinforce and deepen students’ conceptual understanding
in Science.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<br>As an extension to classroom experiences, students also attend lessons
that are offered by the Singapore Science Centre. They also get a chance
