<p>In alignment to the MOE’s Curriculum Framework and the School’s Vision,
the science teachers in Cedar use the Inquiry-Based Learning Approach to
teach Science and through the various hands-on activities, we hope that
our students are able relate the role of Science in their daily life, society
and environment.
<br>The teachers also plan Science programmes and work with key partners to
nurture the joy of learning and to promote lifelong learning.
<br>Below are the programmes that the students will experience in Cedar Primary
School:</p>
