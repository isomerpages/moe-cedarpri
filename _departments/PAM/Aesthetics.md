### Vision and Mission

We believe that Art will contribute to the development of:

*   A confident person
*   Aself-directed learner
*   An active contributor
*   A concerned citizen.

The Art Education in Cedar Primary School aims to expose, educate and equip students with the necessary skills to express themselves confidently, as well as to provide them with enriching experiences and equal opportunities to succeed in their artistic expressions.

Aligned with MOEâ€™s aim of Art Education, we also ensure that we enable every child to enjoy Art, communicate visually and make meaning through connecting with society and culture. By the end of 6 years of Art Education in primary school, all students will become Active Artists and Informed Audience who are able to See, Express and Appreciate Art.
