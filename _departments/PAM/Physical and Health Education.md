# **Physical and Health Education**

### Vision and Mission

"The purpose of physical education is to enable students

to demonstrate individually and with others, the

physical skills, practices and values to enjoy a lifetime of

active, healthy living."

~ PE Syllabus 2014 ~

Physical Education (PE) is about movement. Movement is fundamental and essential to life, work, and play. Movement competency facilitates participation and allows individuals to derive pleasure and satisfaction from physical activities. An individual who can move proficiently has the skills and knowledge related to movement, and values purposeful moving for life. PE, therefore, is responsible for helping students take on the responsibility of learning by providing them with the capacity to make reasoned and wise choices through a lifelong process of change. 


### Curriculum and Programmes

In PE, students are exposed to learning areas such as

*   Athletics (from Primary 3)
*   Dance
*   Games and Sports
*   Gymnastics
*   Outdoor Education
*   Physical Health and Fitness
*   Swimming (at Primary 3)

Our syllabus content focuses on exposing students to the fundamentals of games and sports throughout each academic year and broad-based development through a range of enjoyable and varied physical activities during the formative years. It will also make use of the PE settings to help our students develop their characters and values.

Together with other school programmes, PE contributes to holistic education and the development of 21st Century Competencies to better prepare our students to thrive in a fast-changing and highly-connected world.
