### Vision and Mission

The Music Programme in Cedar Primary School is designed to meet the demands and needs of our diverse groups of students. This six-year programme has been carefully tiered to holistically develop the student into a musical individual who is also competent in 21st Century Skills such as creativity, collaborative and critical thinking skills.

### Curriculum and Programmes

In lower primary, a combination of Orff Schulwerk Music & Movement and Dalcroze Eurythmics focusses on child-centred learning and in developing the child’s individual musical voice and creativity.

Collaborating with one another, middle primary students are given opportunities to choreograph performances from scratch so that they can showcase them during school events. With a focus on artistic integrity, the students learn to be kind to their peers and be responsible for their own contributions in their teams.

Upper primary students get the chance to harness the power of technology during lessons when they explore virtual instruments on the iPad or manipulate timbres and textures on Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) Software to create an experimental sound collage.

In addition to learning musical concepts and ideas throughout the six years, students will also develop resilience while being challenged to learn a variety of instruments such as handbells, ukulele, xylophone, recorder, Latin percussion, boomwhackers, guitar, Angklung & Kompang.
