<p>The English Language Department fosters a lifelong passion for learning
by nurturing joyful learners, critical thinkers, and creative communicators.
We empower students to think critically, express themselves creatively,
and take joy in mastering the English language.
<br>

<br><em>Joyful learners, critical thinkers, and creative communicators.</em>
<br>
<br><strong>Our Mission</strong>
<br><em>To empower students to think critically, communicate creatively, and find joy in mastering the English language.</em>
<br>
<br><strong>Our Approach</strong>
<br>We provide a comprehensive and engaging English curriculum that nurtures
students’ literacy skills across reading, writing, speaking, and listening.
Our approach is grounded in:
<br>
<br><strong>Interactive &amp; Engaging Learning:</strong>
<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; STELLAR 2.0 enhances structured
literacy development through engaging, research-backed strategies.
<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Integration of EdTech tools (e.g.
SLS, Google Classroom, Padlet) to support digital literacy
<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gamified learning experiences (e.g.
Kahoot, Blooket)
<br>
<br><strong>Fostering confident communicators equipped with 21st-century skills</strong>
</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Public speaking and stimulus-based
conversation activities to develop articulation and confidence</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creative writing and reflective
journaling to encourage self-expression</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exposure to multicultural literature,
global issues, and current affairs to enhance critical thinking and media
literacy</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Current affairs discussions (e.g.
sustainability, technology) to build civic awareness and cultural literacy</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Differentiated Learning &amp; Inclusive Support:</strong>
</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supplementary, Remedial &amp; Support
Programmes (LSP, RRP, SDR, KidsRead, Caterpillar Club) to support all learners</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use of assistive technologies (Text-to-Speech,
Immersive Reader) for literacy accessibility</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A structured scaffolding approach
ensures students receive the support needed to strengthen their language
skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Student Leadership &amp; Enrichment:</strong>
</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Participation in reading initiatives
(e.g. READ@CPS, Storytime Spectacular, Cedar News Bytes)</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Writing competitions and national-level
public speaking opportunities</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collaborative projects that incorporate
21st Century Competencies, such as teamwork, problem-solving, and digital

perspectives.
