<h3>Vision and Mission</h3>
<p>Every student can learn Math concepts and skills, given time and at his/her
own pace.</p>
<p>For every student, we strive to develop a mathematical mindset translated
into the following behaviour:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Focus on learning concepts and skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply the concepts and skills in different contexts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persevere and try alternative strategies if one strategy does not work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check for accuracy by coming up with alternative strategies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reflect and learn from mistakes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Curriculum and Programmes</h3>
<p><strong>Our Pedagogy</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Gradual Release of Responsibility</strong>
</p>
<p>Our teachers adopt the Gradual Release of Responsibility (GRR) Instructional
Structure with the intent of teachers transiting from assuming all the
responsibility for performing a task or solving a problem to students assuming
all of the responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract Approach</strong>
</p>
<p>Math lessons are characterised by students manipulating concrete materials
to develop fundamental concepts before the transition to pictorial and
then abstract representations.</p>

<h3>Math Trails and Learning Journeys</h3>
<p>Math trails and learning journeys provide opportunities for students to
apply Math concepts beyond the four walls of a classroom in real-life situations.
On Math trails and learning journeys, students are actively and meaningfully
engaged. Such trails and journeys motivate and enthuse students to solve
problems. In the process, students have more opportunities to work collaboratively
with their peers.</p>
<p>Where applicable and relevant, the use of ICT is infused into the curriculum
for topics such as graphs, pie-charts and average. Students are also enthused
to develop factual fluency in the four operations by engaging in online
math games.</p>
<h3>Our Enrichment Programme - E2K Math Programme</h3>
<p></p>
<p>To stretch the potential of our P4 and P5 students who demonstrate an
aptitude and a flair for mathematical problem-solving, they will participate
in the Math E2K programme and be challenged to solve non-routine questions.</p>
<p>In Primary 5, students who demonstrate the aptitude and interest can participate
in the National Mathematical Olympiad of Singapore (NMOS) organized by
NUS High School of Math and Science.</p>
