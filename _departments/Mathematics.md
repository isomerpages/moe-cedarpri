### Vision and Mission

Every student can learn Math concepts and skills, given time and at his/her own pace. 

For every student, we strive to develop a mathematical mindset translated into the following behaviour:

*   Focus on learning concepts and skills
*   Apply the concepts and skills in different contexts
*   Persevere and try alternative strategies if one strategy does not work
*   Check for accuracy by coming up with alternative strategies
*   Reflect and learn from mistakes.
  

### Curriculum and Programmes

**Our Pedagogy**

**Gradual Release of Responsibility**

Our teachers adopt the Gradual Release of Responsibility (GRR) Instructional Structure with the intent of teachers transiting from assuming all the responsibility for performing a task or solving a problem to students assuming all of the responsibility.

**Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract Approach**

Math lessons are characterised by students manipulating concrete materials to develop fundamental concepts before the transition to pictorial and then abstract representations.
