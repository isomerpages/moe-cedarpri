All ICT baseline lessons are strategically integrated with specific subjects and are carried out during curriculum hours by the subject teachers with assistance from the ICT department. The baseline programmes help ensure that our students have achieved a certain level of competency in their ICT skills before they are exposed to more ICT-infused lessons as they progress up the levels.





**Cyber Wellness**

Cedar Primary School's Cyber Wellness approach is guided by MOE's Cyber Wellness framework.

### Sense

The first step in inculcating these principles is to create cyber awareness among the students. Students should be able to “sense” the risks of harmful behaviours online and learn how to manage such risks as well as protect themselves from the dangers.


### Think

To develop students’ ability to respond to new encounters in cyberspace, it is important to provide opportunities for students to analyse, evaluate and reflect on cyber wellness issues.


### Act

Students should eventually translate their understanding into actions that will keep them safe while online.

INTERNET SAFETY PLEDGE

We, the students of Cedar Primary School,  
pledge ourselves to be safe online.    
Regardless of changing technologies and evolving issues,    
we promise to be responsible and kind digital citizens.    
So as to achieve cyber wellness   
and become Cybersmart Cedarians.

  

**Traits of a Cybersmart Cedarian **

1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I will not give out personal information such as my address, telephone number or the name and location of my school without my parents' permission.

2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I will tell my parents right away if I come across any information or content that makes me feel uncomfortable.

3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I will never agree to get together with someone that I meet online without first checking with my parents.

4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I will not respond to any messages that are mean or that in any way make me feel uncomfortable. If I receive a message like that, I will tell my parents or teachers right away.

5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I will be courteous and kind to others while communicating online.

6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I will stand against cyberbullying and help others by reporting the incident to my teachers or parents.

7.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I will maintain a healthy and balanced lifestyle between the physical and cyber world. For my own well-being, if I&nbsp;**sense**&nbsp;any risks of harmful behaviours online, I will&nbsp;**think**&nbsp;carefully, make well-considered decisions and&nbsp;**act**&nbsp;responsibly in the cyber space.
