**Vision and Mission**

Communicating Effectively, Thinking Creatively,

In the Cyber World

------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

The ICT department serves to spearhead the school’s efforts in the integration of ICT into the curriculum to develop 21CC and nurturing of responsible citizens of the cyber world
  
**Curriculum and Programmes**
 

### ICT Baseline Programmes

*   Primary 1 – Basic Computer Operations and Touch-typing skills
*   Primary 2 – MS Word
*   Primary 3 – MS PowerPoint / Nearpod
*   Primary 4 – MS Excel
*   Primary 5 – MS Excel
*   Primary 6 – Coding

All ICT baseline lessons are strategically integrated with specific subjects and are carried out during curriculum hours by the subject teachers with assistance from the ICT department. The baseline programmes help ensure that our students have achieved a certain level of competency in their ICT skills before they are exposed to more ICT-infused lessons as they progress up the levels.


### Cyber Wellness

Cedar Primary School's Cyber Wellness approach is guided by MOE's Cyber Wellness framework.
