<h1><strong>Student Management</strong></h1>
<h3>Vision and Mission</h3>
<p><strong>Vision</strong>
<br>Self-disciplined Cedarians who uphold the Mark of a Cedarian.</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong>
<br>To teach, guide and inspire students to develop self-discipline and good
character.
<br>
<br>In Cedar Primary School, we believe that every teacher is a discipline
teacher. Discipline is an educational process of developing students’ thinking
and moral faculties, as aligned with our school rules and school values
of Kindness, Integrity, Resilience, Responsibility and Creativity. We adopt
Positive Discipline as a model to focus on changing the belief behind the
behaviour rather than focusing only on the behaviour. Positive Discipline
is a programme developed by Dr. Jane Nelsen to teach young people to become
responsible, respectful and resourceful members of their communities. Positive
Discipline teaches important social and life skills in a manner that is
deeply respectful and encouraging for both children and adults.
<br>
<br>As the saying goes, “It takes a village to raise a child”. Hence, we adopts
a whole-school, multi-pronged approach by collaborating and communicating
with staff, families, partners and external agencies to ensure that a consistent
approach is used in developing our students holistically.</p>

<p><strong>Kind and firm</strong> - Is <strong><em>mutually respectful and encouraging</em></strong>.
Adults model firmness by respecting themselves and the needs of the situation,
and kindness by respecting the needs of the child.</p>
<p><strong>Belonging and significance</strong> - Helps children feel a <strong><em>sense of connection</em></strong> to
the school through <strong><em>Positive TSR, Positive PSR and a caring and enabling school environment</em></strong>,
thus allowing the students to feel safe and respected at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Teaches valuable social and life skills</strong> – Students develop
good characters and <strong><em>learn all valuable skills</em></strong> that
benefit them for the years to come.</p>
<p><strong>Student Empowerment </strong>- <strong><em>Invites children to discover how capable they are</em></strong>,
and use their <strong><em>power </em></strong>in <strong><em>constructive </em></strong>ways
and <strong><em>make good decisions</em></strong>.</p>
