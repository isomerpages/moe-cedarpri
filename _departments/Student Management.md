<h1><strong>Student Management</strong></h1>
<h3>Vision and Mission</h3>
<p><strong>Vision</strong>
<br>Self-disciplined Cedarians who uphold the Mark of a Cedarian.</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong>
<br>To teach, guide and inspire students to develop self-discipline and good
character.
<br>
<br>In Cedar Primary School, we believe that every teacher is a discipline
teacher. Discipline is an educational process of developing students’ thinking
and moral faculties, as aligned with our school rules and school values
of Kindness, Integrity, Resilience, Responsibility and Creativity. We adopt
Positive Discipline as a model to focus on changing the belief behind the
behaviour rather than focusing only on the behaviour.
<br>Positive Discipline is a programme developed by Dr. Jane Nelsen to teach
young people to become responsible, respectful and resourceful members
of their communities. Positive Discipline teaches important social and
life skills in a manner that is deeply respectful and encouraging for both
children and adults.
<br>As the saying goes, “It takes a village to raise a child”. Hence, we adopts
a whole-school, multi-pronged approach by collaborating and communicating
with staff, families, partners and external agencies to ensure that a consistent
approach is used in developing our students holistically.</p>

<p><strong>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STUDENT LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME</strong>
</p>
<p>The Student Leadership Programme aims to develop students with leadership
capabilities and the desire to contribute to the community.</p>
<p>The school conceptualised a three-level approach to cater to the developmental
needs of all students with differing leadership abilities and potential.
This 3-level approach aims to provide more intentional leadership opportunities
to all students based on the rationale of grooming leaders to first have
competent self-management skills, then create an impact in their classrooms,
the school and finally the community.</p>
