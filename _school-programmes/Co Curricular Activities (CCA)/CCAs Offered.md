### Sports and Outdoor Education

#### Adventure Club

Adventure Club exposes students to Outdoor Learning, Sports Climbing and Sports Orienteering. Sports Climbing trains students to focus and build their confidence as they ascend the wall. Orienteering is called a thinking sport where students learn to be self-reliant and hone their skills in navigating and decision-making while problem-solving to locate each checkpoint.
