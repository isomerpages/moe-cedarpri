#### Overview
The CCA Tryouts is a platform for our Primary 2 students to learn about and experience an authentic preview about the various CCAs that they may be interested in through hands-on activities. Through this, we hope parents/guardians will be able to make informed decisions together with their children/wards when selecting their CCA during the CCA Registration Exercise.
 

#### Signing Up for CCA Tryouts
The CCA Tryouts is conducted in mid-Term 4 during CCA days where students will have the opportunity to experience up to 6 different CCAs. Parents/Guardians can book these slots online.

More details of the CCA Tryouts will be provided to Primary 2 parents/guardians at the start of of Term 4.


#### Things to Note:
Participation in the CCA Tryouts is optional.
Participation in the CCA Tryouts is not a prerequisite when assigning students to their CCA of choice during the CCA Registration Exercise.
Parents/Guardians must make their own transport arrangement for the child/ward. For those taking the school bus, do liase with the bus vendor directly.
