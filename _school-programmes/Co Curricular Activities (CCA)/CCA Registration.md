#### Overview
The CCA Registration Exercise encourages every Primary 2 student to sign up for a CCA. They will begin their journey in the assigned CCA the following year when they are in Primary 3. 

Parents/Guardians are encouraged to discuss with your child/ward on their interests. The CCA Registration Exercise, which is conducted online, requires students to make three CCA choices of no order of priority. The school will assign students to one of the three choices made.

More details of the CCA Registration Exercise will be provided to Primary 2 parents/guardians in the middle of Term 4.
