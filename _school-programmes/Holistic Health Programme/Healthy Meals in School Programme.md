# **Healthy Meals in School Programme**

The school has implemented the Healthy Meals in Schools Programme (HMSP) since 2016 to build a supportive environment to promote healthy eating among the students. This programme encourages the sale of healthier food and beverage in our school canteen.  

The programme provides schools with a set of food service guidelines that aim to

*   reduce the amount of fat, salt and sugar in food preparation
*   encourage the consumption of fruit and vegetables, and wholegrains
*   develop the habit of eating balanced meal through the sale of set meals (_see my healthy plate below_).

To grow healthily, students need the nutritious benefits from the consumption of healthier and balanced meals. The programme supports increased consumption of wholegrains, fruits and vegetables while reducing saturated fat, sugar and salt in school meals. The healthier eating habits inculcated from young in the school setting will help them make healthier choices outside of school and later in life.
