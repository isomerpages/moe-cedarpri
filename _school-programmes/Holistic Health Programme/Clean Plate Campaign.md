# **Clean Plate Campaign**

The Clean Plate Campaign aims at teaching students to be mindful of the amount of food that they eat so as to avoid food wastage. In addition, through this campaign, students are able to understand the impact of food wastage on the environment and the society.  

During this programme, volunteers from the Food from The Heart (FFTH) will share information with our students to raise their awareness on the amount of food wasted in Singapore and the benefits of not wasting food.

PE teachers work closely with the Social Studies department to conduct lessons to sensitise students to the impact of food wastage on society. Through these efforts, we hope to encourage all our students to cultivate the habit of taking only the food they can finish and leave behind no leftovers.
