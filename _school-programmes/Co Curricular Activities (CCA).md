# **Co-Curricular Activities**

Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) are an integral part of the school experience at Cedar Primary School, seeking to nurture interests, develop talents and cultivate a zest for life. CCAs are also part of the holistic, well-rounded education that we seek to provide for our students. They also provide a valuable platform for the development of character and cultivation of friendships, thus nurturing Kind, Resilient, Responsible and Creative students who have Integrity as their foundation.

CCAs also fuel in our students a lifelong love for a particular activity, be it a sport or a musical pursuit. This helps the students to lead a balanced life in adulthood. All CCAs emphasise social interaction but each CCA has its specific objectives. Students who demonstrate a high level of attainment in their CCAs may be selected to represent the school in competitions and performances.

The following are the skills and values that the specific CCAs aim to impart:

| CCA 	| Skills and Values 	|
|---	|---	|
| Sports and Outdoor Education CCAs 	| Fair play, team spirit, self-reliance, resilience, discipline and a spirit of service to others. 	|
| Arts CCAs 	| A sense of graciousness and an appreciation for the rich culture and heritage of a multi-racial society 	|
| Inventiveness CCA 	| Entrepreneurial spirit, a risk-taking attitude and an appreciation for aesthetics 	|
| Uniformed Group CCAs 	| Discipline, leadership resilience and endurance; useful life skills, such as tent-pitching, outdoor cooking and first aid 	|
| Literary, Drama and Debate Club 	| Language acquisition and exploration through hands-on activities, which encourages collaboration with peers 	|
| Kindness Club 	| Problem solving and solution implementation to promote kindness within the school and the community 	|
