**Applied Learning Programme: Creative and Inventive Thinking (CIT)**

With the aim of developing the spirit of ‘entrepreneurial dare’ in our students to better prepare them to face challenges in a VUCA environment while actively contributing to society, the school decided to adopt Creative and Inventive Thinking (CIT) as our Applied Learning Programme.

**Vision**

To develop creative leaders who impact the community positively

**CIT Curriculum**

All students go through the Creative Problem Solving process during their 6 years in Cedar.

In Semester 1, the curriculum focuses on the use of thinking tools which students use to identify and analyse problems/challenges in a given scenario (P1-P2) or school/community (P3-P6), generate solutions and evaluate solutions. Students are taught a variety of thinking tools such as the CEDAR Idea Generator (adapted from SCAMPER) and ALoU, which they then apply in their community problem solving / tinkering projects.

In Semester 2, the curriculum focuses on tinkering/prototyping where students get to experiment with materials and ideas to discover and understand their potential of uses and, to reinforce their learning to find better solutions to current problems. Students are exposed to construction tools such as LEGO blocks, Strawbees, Makedo and recycled materials. In the long run, they become more inquiry-oriented and more confident about their ideas.

**Inventopia: Tinker Space**

To better support students’ tinkering/prototyping projects, a makerspace (Inventopia: Tinker Space) was developed, providing students with a space for exploring and bringing their ideas to life.

**Creativity Fest**

Creativity Fest was introduced to allow students to share their toy creations (P1-P2) / community problem solving projects (P3-P6) with their peers. It also serves as a platform to develop our students as effective communicators and to further inspire students to become young changemakers.

**Future Innovators’ Programme**

Future Innovators’ Programme (FIP) is a co-curricular activity (CCA) established with the aim
of stretching and enhancing our students’ problem-solving capacity. Students who have demonstrated interest and aptitude in this area are invited to join the programme. 

In FIP, students learn advanced thinking skills and are mentored for various creative competitions such as the Sony Creative Science Award (SCSA), Future Problem Solving Programme (FPSP) and Innovation Programme.
