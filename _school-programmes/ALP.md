**Applied Learning Programme: Creative and Inventive Thinking (CIT)**

With the aim of developing the spirit of ‘entrepreneurial dare’ in our students to better prepare them to face challenges in a VUCA environment while actively contributing to society, the school decided to adopt Creative and Inventive Thinking (CIT) as our Applied Learning Programme.

**Vision**

To develop creative leaders who impact the community positively

**CIT Curriculum**

All students go through the Creative Problem Solving process during their 6 years in Cedar.

In Semester 1, the curriculum focuses on the use of thinking tools which students use to identify and analyse problems/challenges in a given scenario (P1-P2) or school/community (P3-P6), generate solutions and evaluate solutions. Students are taught a variety of thinking tools such as the CEDAR Idea Generator (adapted from SCAMPER) and ALoU, which they then apply in their community problem solving / tinkering projects.

In Semester 2, the curriculum focuses on tinkering/prototyping where students get to experiment with materials and ideas to discover and understand their potential of uses and, to reinforce their learning to find better solutions to current problems. Students are exposed to construction tools such as LEGO blocks, Strawbees, Makedo and recycled materials. In the long run, they become more inquiry-oriented and more confident about their ideas.
