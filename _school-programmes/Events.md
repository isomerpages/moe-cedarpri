<p><strong>February</strong>
</p>
<p>Total Defence Day was commemorated with a meaningful series of activities
that deepened students' understanding of the six pillars of Total Defence.
Throughout the week, daily sharings highlighted the importance of resilience
and unity, beginning with a thought-provoking skit during assembly. To
provide a hands-on experience, students participated in a water disruption
and rationing exercise, fostering awareness of resource conservation.</p>

<p>Adding to the enriching programme, two local writers, Ms Emily Lim and
Ms Tan Ter Cheah, shared their inspiring life stories, encouraging students
to embrace courage and determination. Team-building games during recesses
brought students together in the spirit of camaraderie, while a special
sharing session at the school library on the bravery of Lieutenant Adnan
offered a powerful lesson in sacrifice and patriotism. The commemoration
left students with a deeper appreciation of Singapore’s collective strength
and the role each of them plays in defending our nation.</p>
