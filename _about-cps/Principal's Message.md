<p><strong>Principal’s Message 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>It is with much enthusiasm, warmth and hope that we welcome you to the
year 2025. We are confident that with a good character, a positive attitude
towards learning, sustained effort and a resilient mindset, our students
will continue to scale greater heights with us. I know that my work here
will continue to be a deeply meaningful one because of the support from
students, teachers, staff, parents and partners. Let us continue to work
together to enable our shared belief, identity and aspirations for Cedar
Primary to take deeper roots in the hearts of Cedarians.</p>
<p><strong>Our School Motto - Our Belief</strong>
</p>
<p>Our school motto, Effort Determines Success, encapsulates our belief that,
when given equal opportunities, all of us can succeed with determination
and hard work. Success is not dependent solely on the abilities or brains
we are born with, because we can develop these abilities with the right
attitude and effort. This belief compels us to continuously improve and
innovate in the things we do.</p>
<p><strong>Our School Values - Our Identity</strong>
</p>
<p>Our values define us. They tell others who we are. In Cedar Primary, Cedarians
learn to uphold the school values of Kindness, Integrity, Resilience, Responsibility
and Creativity. They are kind and compassionate, helping others without
asking for anything in return. They are honest and choose to do what is
right even when no one is watching. They persevere in the face of challenges
and put in effort to work towards their goals. They think before they act
and take pride in doing their best. They are eager to learn new things
and try out new ideas, turning new ideas into reality. Cedarians have a
positive influence on the local community and through their collective
effort, contribute to the development of a gracious and inclusive society.</p>
<p><strong>Our School Mission - Our Purpose</strong>
</p>
<p>Our mission defines our purpose as a school. We want to build a safe and
positive environment where we can uplift all Cedarians to reach their potential.
We will nurture minds by imparting knowledge, developing competencies and
dispositions so that our students enjoy learning and become lifelong learners.
We will imbue values, foster attitudes and confidence that empower Cedarians
to connect with our community and make a positive difference to it. We
exist, as a school, because we are driven by our mission: Nurturing Minds.
Inspiring Hearts. Empowering Lives.</p>
<p><strong>Our School Vision - Our Aspirations</strong>
</p>
<p>The school vision: Joyful Learners, Responsible Citizens and Creative
Leaders in a Connected Community is our collective expression of the school’s
aspirations for Cedarians: students and staff. We aspire to empower Cedarians
to find joy in learning, in school or at home, through self-directed or
collaborative ways. We aspire to nurture them to be principles-centred
persons driven by a sense of responsibility to serve and lead. We aspire
to enable Cedarians to lead creatively: always seeking righteous and innovative
ways to improve the lives of those around them and in so doing, contribute
to the building of a positive and connected community.</p>
<p><strong>Our Commitment, Your Partnership</strong>
</p>
<p>Our vision, mission, values and motto also represent our staff’s and teachers’
commitment to continue to learn and pass on the joy of learning to our
students. They call upon us to lead and care for the students that we teach.
They ask that we work harmoniously to bring out the best in our students
and inspire them through our actions.</p>
<p>For parents, we ask that you continue to partner us in our journey towards
fulfilling the school vision. Build this partnership based on mutual trust
and respect; have confidence in the professionalism of our teachers and
staff. We welcome feedback and ask that we both be receptive to the feedback
that we will have for each other. Our objectives are the same: we both
want the best for your children, our students. We must help each other
grow so that we become better parents and educators respectively.</p>
<p><strong>For the Students</strong>
</p>
<p>For each and every Cedarian, you recite the national pledge with your
hand over your heart every day. Remember that between your hand and your
heart is the school crest that represents our vision, mission and values,
and bears our school motto: Effort Determines Success. Each day, you pledge
upon this school crest, holding it close to your heart. We hope that you
think about how to live these values and fulfil our school vision. Every
kind, righteous, resilient, responsible and creative effort, no matter
how small, counts. With practice, the day will come when you can follow
your hearts’ desires without going against what is right. Your teachers
are here to help you grow. Choose to let them nurture you. Listen to and
let them guide you towards successes.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>
</p>
<p>In the words of Aristotle, “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence therefore
is not an act but a habit.” We will humbly remember that our successes
are a result of the efforts we repeatedly put into what we do. Let us continue
to strive for successes in 2025, in the big and little things we do every
single day, for the students and community we have been called to serve.
Have a meaningful and enriching 2025!</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<br><strong>Principal</strong>
