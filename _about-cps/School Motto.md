# **School Motto**

_**Effort** Determines **Success**_


*   The motto **_Effort Determines Success_** encapsulates our belief that, when given equal opportunities, all of us can succeed, if we have the determination and put in hard work. Success is not dependent solely on the abilities or brains we are born with, because these abilities can be developed with the right attitude and effort.

*   The word **_Determines_** highlights the importance of the choice every individual makes, in the pursuit of success.

*   **_Success_** in the motto refers to success in the different areas of growth: cognitive, physical, aesthetics, social, moral and emotional. Success is about achieving the goals we set for ourselves in these aspects; it is also about having the excellence mindset and giving our best in everything that we do.
