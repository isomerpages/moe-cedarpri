**School Colours**

*   **Blue** is the colour of the sky and sea, which are infinite open spaces, representing boundless opportunities for all Cedarians to explore our talents, interests and imagination.
*   **White** is the colour of goodness and purity, reminding all Cedarians to always think, speak and act with kind intents.

**The shield** symbolises the school’s safe environment in which all Cedarians can learn and play.

**The 5 stars** represent the school values of _Kindness, Integrity, Resilience, Responsibility and Creativity._

**The CP tree in the form of the infinity sign** emphasises our belief that every Cedarian has infinite potential to grow and become better every day.

**Scroll-like Banner**

*   The banner, located near the base of the crest, stands for our belief that learning is the foundation for Cedarians’ growth.
*   The scroll depicts our ideal that every Cedarian enjoys learning and expanding their knowledge about the world.
