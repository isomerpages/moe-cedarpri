<h1><b>School Song</b></h1>


**Verse 1**

<img src="/images/School%20Song.png" style="width:300px;height:450px;margin-left:15px;" align = "right">

Cedarians with hopes and dreams
We work and play respectfully in teams
The efforts we make, the success we create
The joy of learning, we will celebrate


**Chorus**

We love our school, the place to be
Where learning abounds for you and me
Together we sing, our voices ring
Cedar Primary, Our family

**Verse 2**

We learn and serve with humility
With resilience, and integrity
Creative and kind, we strive to be
For our bright future, our responsibility.

**Chorus**
